<p><b><center><h1> Pets </h1></center></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center">  Although with my 4 brothers my house is crawling with 3 fury friends. I have one dog (Bonnie) and two cats (Tapioca and Paxton). Bonnie is a yellow lab who loves to be around people and will eat anything that touches the floor. Paxton is my favorite because he is the king in my house, he goes outside and kills any rodent or larger animal he can and then comes back inside and sits wherever he sees fit. My other cat tapioca is a polar opposite, most of his days are spent hiding from the loud noises coming from my family. </center></p>
