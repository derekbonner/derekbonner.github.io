<p><b><center><h1> Music </h1></center></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center"> I would consider my music taste unique, my favorite band is Eagles. I first started listening to classic rock my freshmen year of high school and after a few years of listening Eagles stand alone as my favorite band of all time. I personally think they produce the best sound and love the music they made. My favorite album by Eagles is One of These Nights (1975), with lying eyes being my favorite track on the album. I have been listening to the Eagles for 4 years now and donâ€™t plan on slowing down anytime soon. </center></p>
