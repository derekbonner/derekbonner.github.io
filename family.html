<p><b><center><h1> Family </h1></center></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center">Family, My family consists of 5 boys; Robert, Ian, Mark, Kurt, and yes myself as the youngest. We all share many of the same interests including football, basketball, hockey, and baseball. Along with sharing the same interests in sports three of my four older brothers have majored finance. The only non-business major is my eldest brother Robert (28) who is an English teacher in Michigan. Ian (26) graduated from Bryant University and has been working for several years now, Mark (24) just graduated from Bentley University this past spring and has recently been hired. Kurt (21) is in his third year at Quinnipiac University and plans on graduating with a finance degree. We were all raised by my wonderful mother; Susan. She is was grew up in Weston Massachusetts which is right next to our home in Wayland Massachusetts. Susan now works in Milton as a French immersion teacher. </center></p>
