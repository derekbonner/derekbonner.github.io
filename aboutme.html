<P> My name is Derek Bonner, I am a first year student at the university of Maine, I am from Wayland Massachusetts, and am the youngest of 5 boys. Asides from my eldest brother who is a teacher in Michigan I am following a long line of business majors, so naturally I made the easy decision to begin my path in business.
<p> Growing up I developed a passion for sports, me and my family loved to both play and watch sports. We are huge Boston sports fans, in particular the Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox, and Bruins. Personally the Celtics are my favorite team to watch because basketball is my favorite sport. Aside from basketball I also played football and baseball. Sports were a huge part of me and my family growing up and I still very much enjoy playing basketball and watching my favorite Boston teams.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center"> One of my favorite places on earth is my house on the Cape. My family has a house in Masphee, which we spend pretty much all our vacation time. Having older brothers can make it difficult to spend quality family time together because they are all onto starting their own lives now, so having a house where we can all come together in the summer really helps keep my family close. There is always tons of family and friends and great food when we go down. Im looking forward to spending my first college summer down at my favorite place. </center></p>
