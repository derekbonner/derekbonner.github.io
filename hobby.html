<p><b><center><h1> Hobby </h1></center></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center">  My major hobby is basketball, whether is playing, watching, or reading about basketball I cant get enough. After my high school basketball career has ended I have found a new life from my game trying to become a better player everyday. I typically play basketball 5 times a week playing multiple pick-up games at the rec center in the afternoon and intramural games Monday and Wednesday. My favorite time of the year for basketball is the summer for two reasons, first the NBA season is wrapping up and so the NBA finals are on and secondly during the summer I play in an Outdoor Basketball League, which I love playing in. </center></p>
